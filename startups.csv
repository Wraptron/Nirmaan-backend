It can be applied as a foliar spray or through drip irrigation, making it versatile for various crops and farming conditions.
By reducing the use of harmful chemical pesticides by up to 60%, Azeedo Shield improves soil health, reduces input costs, and increases crop yields by 12–30%. It is affordable and effective across diverse Indian agro-climatic zones. Additionally, the production model is decentralized, working with Farmer Producer Organizations to locally manufacture and distribute the product, creating rural employment opportunities.

Equipped with motion sensors, it continuously tracks posture, movement angles, and muscle activation to ensure correct form and steady progress. Our adaptive algorithm personalizes and updates exercise routines based on sensor feedback, targeting the right muscles at the right stage of recovery.
Clinicians receive detailed reports on muscle performance and range of motion, enabling data-driven decisions early in the rehab process. This helps prevent long-term issues caused by improper movement patterns or muscle imbalances, ensuring patients stay on the right recovery path and regain full mobility more effectively.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=10n5P9UZoxSsSX8ThxDbZbCdTB1ukA6lI

As part of the course, we were told to do mini-projects in which there was a particular one that I submitted inspired by the Amazonian water lotus. I thought why not use nature's design to our advantage. You already know the difficulties of rooftop solar panels right. Especially, when you have to hear granny complain when she doesn't have space to hang the clothes. (She is abs ok if the panels receive filtered sunlight. Clothes are her 1st priority). There might be trees, natural obstructions, cloudy weather that affects the generation of solar energy. Keeping these in mind, why not keep these panels on water. But I want to do it in the cheapest possible way. I want to harness tidal energy also. Wanna know how. Read next para.",Link,,,,,,,,,

One of the primary problems we are tackling is the lack of access to accurate and timely information regarding soil quality, nutrient content, and weather forecasts. Many farmers struggle to make informed decisions about crop selection, fertilizer usage, and irrigation practices due to inadequate data and resources. Additionally, there is a pressing need to optimize resource utilization and maximize crop yield while promoting sustainable agricultural practices. Soil Sarthi seeks to provide solutions to these challenges by leveraging AI/ML technology to analyze vast amounts of data, generate actionable insights, and offer personalized recommendations to farmers. By empowering farmers with access to advanced analytics and predictive modeling, Soil Sarthi aims to enhance productivity, profitability, and environmental sustainability within the agricultural sector.",,,,,,,,,,

We have identified a much deeper social need:
(While our broader focus is on building an Emergency Response Support Ecosystem (ERSE), we are initiating it with sexual assault response as Phase 1.)

Need Identified: Sexual assault survivors, especially in severe cases like rape, face immense delays or failures in getting timely, compassionate, and effective emergency support.

Root Causes:
 - Traditional response systems fail at multiple levels—emergency detection, genuine distress verification, rapid dispatched help, and aftercare.
 - Barriers include social stigma, fear of retaliation, lack of awareness, gaps in reporting mechanisms, and resource constraints among responders.

Validation:
 - Interviews and fieldwork indicating victims struggling to trigger alerts or reach safe support
 - Consultations with police, NGOs, and students exposed the hidden, recurring gaps in campus and city safety systems

Our Solution:
 - Surakshit is a comprehensive, AI-driven emergency response ecosystem for women’s safety, not just another SOS tool
 - Features include discreet emergency detection, human-in-the-loop filtering, rapid verified help involving community responders, drone and robust aftercare support
 - The focus is on closing root-cause gaps: swift alert validation, evidence collection, trauma-informed care, and long-term survivor empowerment

Rationale:
 - This pivot allows us to meaningfully address an urgent, under-served problem with lasting real-world impact, leveraging our technical and research strengths",,,,,,,,,,
